            <h2><b>Spay-Neuter & Medical Clinic</b></h2>
            <p><b>Adopt a Paws’ Spay-Neuter & Medical Clinic provides spay/neuter procedures for animals at Adopt a Paw, animals belonging to breed-placement groups as well as animals belonging to members of the general community. Spay/neuter surgery carries a one-time cost that is relatively small compared to the long-term benefits. Along with helping curb pet overpopulation, spay/neuter surgery allows pets to live longer, healthier lives. It also makes ​them less likely to spray and/or mark territory and eliminates heat cycles. ​Unsterilized animals often exhibit more behavior and temperament problems ​than those who have been spayed or neutered.</b></p>
            <p><b>For more information on Adopt a Paws’ services, please contact the clinic directly at 888-888-8888.</b></p>

            <h2><b>Microchip Clinic</b></h2>
            <p><b>Did you know that one in three pets will get lost in their lifetime? It’s easy to think that it will never happen to your pet. After all, they’re always safely by your side or tucked in at home. But what if? What if a contractor, pet sitter, relative, visitor, or even a thief leaves a door or window open? What if you’re transporting your pet and disaster strikes, and your scared and confused pet runs to find a place to hide? What if a disaster strikes at home? Even the most vigilant and responsible pet owners can lose a pet.</b></p>
            <p><b>Without ID, 90% of the pets that are lost never make it back home. In a study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association they found that only about 22% lost dogs and less than 2% of lost cats that entered shelters without microchips were reclaimed by their owners. However, if they were microchipped the reclaim rate rose to 52% for dogs (a 238% increase) and 38% for cats (more than a 2000% increase)!</b></p>
